# Partial-Differential-Equation-Modeling-of-Actomyosin-Networks-Numerical-Solution-and-Analysis
This repository contains the numerical implementation and analysis scripts used in the thesis entitled "Partial Differential Equation Modeling of Actomyosin Networks: Numerical Solution and Analysis".
# Overview
This project focuses on the development, numerical solution, and systematic analysis of a nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE) model describing the dynamics of actomyosin networks. It provides detailed numerical methods to solve advection-diffusion equations coupled with reaction-advection equations and force balance equations representing actinâ€“myosin interactions.
# Key Features
Numerical solutions using Finite Volume Method (FVM) and Finite Difference Method (FDM).
Parameter studies demonstrating stable steady-state and oscillatory dynamic behaviors.
Grid-refinement convergence tests and error analysis.
